Coffee wisdom
+++++++++++++

If you like sweet milky coffee and the cup of coffee in front of you is too
bitter, what do you do? Do you pray for heavenly assistance to make it more
sweet? Do you blame old kamma and try to accept your bitter coffee fate? Do you
throw the coffee away? None of these, I hope. My suggestion would be to add some
more sugar. And if it's too sweet, add more coffee or more water.

If you know how each ingredient of a cup of coffee affects its taste, you have
the information you need to make it more tasty. If you analyse a situation in
your life until you clearly see the cause and conditions underlying it, you have
the information you need to see where and to what extent you can make wise
changes
