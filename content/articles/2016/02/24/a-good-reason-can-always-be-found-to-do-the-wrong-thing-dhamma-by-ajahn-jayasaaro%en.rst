A good reason can always be found to do the wrong thing. The more educated
people are the easier they find it to justify wrong actions. Indeed, many
intelligent people are able to prove to themselves that the wrong thing is, in
fact, the right thing. The ability to convince  oneself and others that the
wrong thing is the right thing is a dangerous gift.

The untrained mind cannot be fully trusted. As long as our mind still lacks
mindfulness, inner peace and wisdom it can be its own worst enemy. Keep
observing your mind. Through constant observation you will develop the ability
to recognise when you are starting to lie to yourself. Only when you understand
the way that desire and attachment arise in the mind, can you protect the mind
and make it truly trustworthy.
