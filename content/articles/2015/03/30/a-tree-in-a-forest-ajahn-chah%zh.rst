     * - 森林裡的一棵樹
  
       - A Tree in a Forest
  
     * - 阿姜 查
  
       - Venerable Ajahn Chah
  
     * - 序言
  
       - Introduction
  
     * - 阿姜查提醒我們佛陀只能指出修行的道路，卻不能替我們修行，因為真理是不能用語言文字來說明與奉送的。阿姜查教導：「所有的教導只不過是譬喻，用來幫助心靈看到真理，如果在心裡建立起佛陀，那麼我們就可以看到一切事物，視一切事物與我們並沒有什麼差異。」
  
       - Ajahn Chah himself reminded us that the Buddha himself could only point out the way and could not do the practice for us, because the truth is something that cannot be put into words or given away. "All the teachings" Ajahn Chah taught, "are merely similes and comparisons, means to help the mind see the truth. If we establish the Buddha within our mind, then we see everything, we contemplate everything, as no different from ourselves.
  
     * - 許多阿姜查自己用來教導的譬喻來自於他廣泛的森林生活經驗。他的修行就是注視，同時完全地敞開心胸，覺察所有發生於自己身心內外的一切。他曾說，他的修行並無特殊之處，套一句他說的話，他像森林裡的一棵樹。「樹只是樹。」他曾這麼說；而阿姜查就只是阿姜查。然而從這「並無特殊之處」中卻產生了對他自己以及世界的深刻瞭解。
  
       - Many of the similes that Ajahn Chah himself used to teach came out of his vast experience of living in the forest. His practice was simply to watch, all the while being totally open and aware of everything that was happening both inside and outside himself. He would say that his practice was nothing special. He was, in his own words, like a tree in a forest, "A tree is as it is," he's say. And Ajahn Chah was as he was. But out of such "nothing specialness" came a profound understanding of himself and the world.
  
     * - 阿姜查經常說：「在任何時刻，佛法一直在示現著，但只有在心靈寧靜的時候，我們才能瞭解佛法所教導的，因為佛法不用語言文字教導。」阿姜查有這種奇異而神秘的能力能接受此非語言文字之法，而用一種新鮮易解，時而幽默、時而詩意盎然的譬喻形式，來把這種真理傳播給他的聽眾，而且總能敲中最易受感動的心靈深處：「我們好像蛆一樣啊！生命宛如落葉，心如雨水。」
  
       - Ajahn Chah used to say, "The Dhamma is revealing itself in every moment, but only when the mind is quiet can we understand what it is saying, for the Dhamma teaches without words." Ajahn Chah had this uncanny ability to take that wordless Dhamma and convey its truth to his listeners in the form of a simile that was fresh, easy to follow, sometimes humorous, sometimes poetic, but always striking a place in the heart where it would jar or inspire the most: "We are like maggots; life is like a falling leaf; our mind is like rain water."
  
     * - 阿姜查的教導充滿了像這種譬喻及比喻。我們以為把它們蒐集成冊當成一種靈感的泉源會是一個好點子，對那些想中止世間熱惱的人們，他們可以從「森林裡的一棵樹」下的清涼、茂盛的樹陰中得到一些休息。
  
       - The teachings of Ajahn Chah teem with similes and comparisons like these. We thought it would be a good idea to collect them all in the form of a book as a source of inspiration for those who may want some respite from the "heat" of the world and seek some rest in the cool and abundant shade of "a tree in the forest".
  
     * - 第一部分
  
       - Part 1
  
     * - 我們必須藉由譬喻來談佛法，因為佛法沒有一定的形式。它是方的還是圓的？你說不來。唯一的方法就是透過這些譬喻來說明。
  
       - "We have to talk about the Dhamma like this, using similes, because the Dhamma has no form. Is it square or is it round? You can't say. The only way to talk about it is through similes like these."
  
     * - ——阿姜 查

  流浪漢 Aimless Wanderer

     :header-rows: 1
  
     * - 【流浪漢】
  
       - Aimless Wanderer
  
     * - 當我們失去了真正的歸宿時，就像一個沒有目標的流浪漢，流落在街頭。這邊走走，那邊晃晃，一回兒落了腳又得流浪他方。在我們回到真正的家之前，無論如何，都會覺得不舒服，就如同一個離鄉背景的旅人。只有當他再次回到家時，才能真正輕鬆自在。
  
       - When we have no real home, we're like an aimless wanderer out on the road, going this way for a while and then that way, stopping for a while and then setting off again. Until we return to our real home, whatever we do we feel ill at ease, just like somebody who's left his village to go on a journey. Only when he gets home again can he really relax and be comfortable.
  
     * - 在這世上我們找不到真正平靜的地方，這是世間的本然。就以觀照你自己的內心代替向外的追求吧！平靜是在你心中找到的。
  
       - Nowhere in the world is any real peace to be found. That's the nature of the world. Look within yourself and find it there instead.
  
     * - 當我們憶念起偉大的佛陀，他所說的是那麼真實，我們感到他是多麼值得尊敬啊！當我們看到事物的真相時，即使我們從來沒有真正地去實踐過佛法，也仍看得到他教導的法。然而，就算我們擁有佛法的知識，而且曾學習和實踐佛法，卻仍見不到真理，那麼我們依舊像流浪漢一樣，無家可歸。
  
       - When we think of the Buddha and how truly he spoke, we feel how worthy he is of reverence and respect. Whenever we see the truth of something, we see his teachings, even if we've never actually practiced Dhamma. But even if we have knowledge of his teachings, have studied and practiced them but still have not seen their truth, then we're still homeless like the aimless wanderer.

     :header-rows: 1
  
     * - 【盲人】
  
       - Blind Man
  
     * - 身和心不停地在生生滅滅，「行」一直處於遷變的狀態中。我們無法如實地透徹這一點，是因為我們仍頑固地深信虛妄不實的事物。好像一位盲人帶路，我們跟他一起旅行怎麼安全呢？他只會引導我們走入密叢和森林之中，看不見的他，怎麼能帶我們走到安全的地方？同樣的道理，我們的心被「行」所矇蔽，以至於在尋求快樂時造作苦：在尋求平靜時造作了困難。我們真的想要解除痛苦與困難，但相反地，我們卻去造作這些，然後只會抱怨而已。我們會造惡因的原因是因為我們對外觀的真相和「行」的真相毫無認識，而且還一再地去執取它們。
  
       - Both the body and mind are constantly arising and ceasing, conditions are in a state of constant turmoil. The reason we can't see this in line with the truth is because we keep believing in the untrue. It's like being guided by a blind man. How can we travel with him in safety? A blind man will only lead us into forests and thickets. How could he lead us to safety when he can't see? In the same way, our mind is deluded by conditions, creating suffering in the search for happiness, creating difficulty in the search for peace. Such a mind can have only problems and suffering. Really, we want to get rid of suffering and difficulty, but instead we create those very things. All we can do is complain. We create bad causes, and the truth of appearances and conditions and try to cling to them.

  一瓶藥 Bottle of Medicine

  .. list-table:: 一瓶藥 Bottle of Medicine [4]_
     :header-rows: 1
  
     * - 【一瓶藥】
  
       - Bottle of Medicine
  
     * - 我們可以將修行比喻為一瓶醫生留給病人的藥。瓶上寫了詳細的說明，指示病人如何服藥，但是，如果這位病人只是閱讀瓶上的說明，無論讀上數百回，都將困死在這兒，永遠得不到藥物的治療。在他死亡之前，還會懷恨地埋怨醫生無能，以及那些藥物並沒有治好他。他會認為醫生是個江湖郎中，或說那些藥物毫無作用，殊不知他只是花時間在檢查瓶子以及閱讀瓶上的說明書，卻沒有聽從醫生的叮嚀而服藥。不管怎麼樣，如果這位病人聽從了醫生的勸囑，照著藥方按時服藥，他便能夠痊癒。
  
       - We can compare practice to a patient who does not take the medicine that his doctor has left for him. Although detailed instructions have been written on the bottle, all the patient does is read them and doesn't actually take the medicine. And before he dies, he may complain bitterly that the doctor wasn't any good; that the medicine didn't cure him. He may think that the doctor was a fake or that the medicine was worthless, yet he had only spent his time examining the bottle and reading its instructions instead of actually taking the medicine. If he had followed the doctor's advice, however, and taken the medicine regularly as prescribed, he would have recovered.
  
     * - 醫生開藥方是為了除去生理上的疾病；佛陀的教法則是治療心理疾病的藥方，使心回覆到自然健康的狀態。因此，佛陀可稱是一位治療心理疾病的醫生，而我們每一個人毫無例外的都有心理的疾病。當你看到這些疾病時，難道不會合理地去尋求佛法做為依靠，就如同拿藥治療你看書的病一般嗎？
  
       - Doctors prescribe medicine to eliminate diseases from the body. The teachings of the Buddha are prescribed to cure diseases of the mind and to bring it back to its natural healthy state. So the Buddha can be considered to be a doctor who prescribes cures for the illnesses of the mind, which are found in each one of us without exception. When you see these illnesses of the mind, does it not make sense to look to the Dhamma as support, as medicine to cure your illnesses?

     * - 【嬉戲的孩子】
  
       - Child Playing
  
     * - 我們對心性反覆地思惟之後，將會瞭解，心就只是心，不會有別的了。我們會明白，心就是心，這是它的本然。如果我們清楚地看清這一點，我們就不會去執著念頭和感覺，只要持續不斷地告訴自己：「它就是如此」，我們就不必要再加些什麼了。當這顆心如實地瞭解，它就能放下一切。雖然仍會有念頭和感覺，但是，每一個念頭和感覺都將失去作用。
  
       - When we have contemplated the nature of the heart many times, we will come to understand that the heart's ways are just as they are and can't be otherwise. They make up the nature of the heart. If we see this clearly, then we can detach from thoughts and feelings. And we don't have to add on anything more if we constantly tell ourselves that "that's just the way it is." When the heart truly understands, it lets go of everything. Thinking and feeling will be deprived of power.
  
     * - 就像剛開始被一個喜歡玩卻會干擾我們的小孩煩擾得很厲害，所以我們責打他，但是，事後我們逐漸明白活潑好動是小孩子的天性，於是我們會任他去玩。我們放下了，我們的煩惱也就消失了。為什麼煩惱會消失呢？因為，現在我們已經接受了孩子的天性，看法也已經改變了，而且已經接受事物的真實面目。我們放下，然後心將會變得更平靜。現在，我們已經有了正見。
  
       - It is like at first being annoyed by a child who likes to play in ways that annoy us so much we scold or spank him. But later we understand that it's natural for a child to play and act like that, so we leave him alone. We let go and our troubles are over. Why are they over? Because we now accept the natural ways of children. Our outlook has changed and we now accept the true nature of things. We let go and our heart becomes more peaceful. We now have right understanding.

     * - 【眼鏡蛇】
  
       - Cobra
  
     * - 心理的活動就像能致人於死的眼鏡蛇。假如我們不去打擾一條眼鏡蛇，它自然會走它的；即使它非常毒，我們也不會受到它的影響；只要我們不走近它或去捉它，它就不會來咬我們。眼鏡蛇會照著它的本性行動，事情就是如此！如果你聰明的話，就別去惹它。同樣地，就讓那些不好的和好的順其自然——依它的本性而隨它去不要執著喜歡和不喜歡，如同你不會去打擾眼鏡蛇一樣。
  
       - Mental activity is like a deadly, poisonous cobra. If we don't interfere with a cobra, it simply goes its own way. Even though it may be extremely poisonous, we are not affected by it. We don't go near it, or take hold of it, and so it doesn't bite us. The cobra does what is natural for a cobra to do. That's the way it is. If you are clever, you'll leave it alone. Likewise, you let be that which is not good - you let it be according to its own nature. You also let be that which is good. Don't grab at liking and disliking, just as you wouldn't grab at the cobra.
  
     * - 一個聰明的人，將會以這種態度來對待在他心中升起的種種情緒。當善的情緒在心中生起時，讓它自是善的，並且瞭解它的本然；同樣地，我們也讓惡的自是惡的，讓它順其自然。不要執著，因為我們什麼都不要！我們不要惡，也不要善；我們不要負擔和輕鬆，乃至不求快樂和痛苦。當我們的欲求止息時，平靜便穩固地建立起來了。
  
       - One who is clever will have this kind of attitude towards the various moods that arise in his mind. When goodness arises, we let it be good. We understand its nature. In the same, we let be the non-good. We let it be according to its nature. We don't take hold of it because we don't want anything. We don't want evil. We don't want good. We don't want heaviness or lightness, happiness or suffering. When our wanting is at an end, peace is firmly established.

  椰子殼 Coconut Shells

     :header-rows: 1
  
     * - 【椰子殼】
  
       - Coconut Shells
  
     * - 欲是染著的，但首先我們必須有欲才能開始修行「道」。假設你到市場去買椰子，提著它們回來時，路上，有人問你：「你為什麼要買這些椰子呢？」
  
       - Desire is a defilement. But we must first have desire in order to start practicing the Way. Suppose you went to buy coconuts at the market and while carrying them back home someone asked: "Why did you buy those coconuts?"
  
     * - 「買來吃啊！」
  
       - "I bought them to eat," you reply.
  
     * - 「你連殼也吃嗎？」
  
       - "Are you going to eat the shells, too?"
  
     * - 「當然不！」
  
       - "Of course not!"
  
     * - 「我不相信。如果你不打算吃殼，又為什麼要買椰子呢？」
  
       - "I don't believe you," he insists. "If you're not going to eat the shells, then why did you buy them?"
  
     * - 好，你怎麼說？你要怎樣回答這個問題？
  
       - Well, what do you say? How are you going to answer that question?
  
     * - 我們是靠著慾望起修的，如果我們沒有慾望，我們就不會去修行。你知道嗎？！這樣思惟可以產生智慧。例如：那些椰子，你要連殼子也一起吃下去嗎？當然不！那又為什麼要椰子殼呢？因為椰子殼的用途是將椰子給包起來，吃了過後，再將殼給扔掉，就沒問題了。
  
       - We practice with desire to begin with. If we didn't have desire, we wouldn't practice. Contemplating in this way can give rise to wisdom, you know. For example, those coconuts: Are you going to eat the shells as well? Of course not. Then why do you take them? They're useful for wrapping the coconuts in. If after eating the coconuts you throw the shells away, there is no problem.
  
     * - 我們的修行也是如此。我們不是要吃殼，只不過現在還不是丟掉殼的時候。我們先將它們收藏起來，就如我們依靠慾望修行一樣，修行便是如此。如果有人硬要說我們連椰子殼也吃，那是他們的事，與我們無關，只要我們清楚自己在做什麼就夠了。
  
       - Our practice is the same. We keep desire first, just like we do with the coconut shells, for it's still not time to "throw" it away. This is how the practice is. If somebody wants to accuse us of eating coconut shells, that's their business. We know what we're doing.

     * - 【烹飪】
  
       - Cooking
  
     * - 首先我們要訓練我們的身和口遠離穢惡，這就是功德。有些人認為要有功德必須整天整夜地背誦巴利文的經句，但事實上，只要使你的身、口清爭無瑕疵，就是功德了。這並不難解，就像在烹調食物，我們放一點點這個，放一點點那個，直到恰到好處、美味可口為止。一旦調配出美味的食物時，就不需再添加任何的東西，因為正確的佐料都已經加了。同樣的道理，確定我們的身行和言語沒有缺失，這樣就可以帶給我們「美味」和恰到好處的功德。
  
       - At first, we train the body and speech to be free of unwholesomeness. This is virtue. Some people think that to have virtue you must memorize Pali phrases and chant all day and night, but really all you have to do is make your body and speech blameless, and that's virtue. It's not so difficult to understand. It's just like cooking food - put in a little bit of this and a little bit of that until it's just right and it's delicious. And once it's delicious, you don't have to put anything else into it. The right ingredients have already been added. In the same way, taking care that our actions and speech are proper will give us delicious virtue, virtue that is just right.

     * - 【瘋子】
  
       - Crazy Man
  
     * - 假設一日清晨，你正走在路上要去工作，有個人無禮地向你叫喊辱罵，霎時，你一聽到這辱罵聲，正常的心便立刻轉變了，你覺得很不舒服，覺得很憤怒和受辱，所以你想要報復。
  
       - Suppose one morning, you're walking to work and a man starts yelling insults at you. As soon as you hear his insults, your mind gets agitated. You don't feel so good, you feel angry and hurt, and you want to get even!
  
     * - 幾天以後，另一個人來你家拜訪，並且告訴你：「嘿，那幾天辱罵你的那個人，他瘋了！而且已經好幾年了！他都是這樣辱罵每個人，但是沒有人會去在意他說的話。」當你聽到這兒，霎時，自在了起來。那以往積鬱在你身上數日的憤怒和不快，完全地消失了，為什麼呢？因為現在你已知道事情的真相。以前你還不知道時，認為那個人是正常的，所以你會憎恨他，同時也導致你痛苦。一旦真相大白，事過境遷：「噢，他是個瘋子！事情原來如此。」
  
       - A few days later, another man comes to your house and tells you, "Hey, that man who abused you the other day, he’s crazy! Has been for years! He abuses everybody like that. Nobody takes notice of anything that he says." As soon as you hear this, you are suddenly relieved. That anger and hurt that you've pent up within you all these days melt away completely. Why? Because now you know the truth. Before, you didn't. You thought that man was normal, so you were angry at him and that caused you to suffer. As soon as you found out the truth, however, everything changed: "Oh, he's mad! That explains everything!"
  
     * - 當你瞭解到這點時，你覺得很舒服，因為你已親身體驗。瞭解了以後，你就能放下。假如你不明白真相，就會去執著。當你認為那位辱罵你的人是正常時，你可能會殺了他，但當你發現事情的真相——他精神失常，你便覺得舒服多了。這就是瞭解真理。
  
       - When you understand the truth, you feel fine because you know for yourself. Understanding, you can then let go. If you don't know the truth, you cling right there. When you thought that the man who abused you was normal, for example, you could have killed him. But when you found out the truth, that he was mad, you felt much better. This is knowledge of the truth.
  
     * - 一個見法的人也有類似的經驗。貪、嗔、痴的消失，是以同樣的方式消失的。當我們不了知這三毒時，我們會認為：「我能夠怎樣呢？我的貪和嗔是如此熾盛。」這並不是清明的認知，跟以為那瘋子是神智健全其實是一樣。只有當我們最後知道他精神失常時，我們的焦慮才得以釋懷。沒有任何人能告知你這些，唯有當心親自體認時，它才能絕滅和捨棄執著。
  
       - Someone who sees the Dhamma has a similar experience. When attachment, aversion and delusion disappear, they disappear in the same way. As long as we don't know these things, we think, "What can I do? I have so much greed and aversion." This is not clear knowledge. It's just the same as when we thought the madman was sane. Until we learned that he was really otherwise, we weren't able to let go of our hurt and anger. Only when the mind sees for itself, can it uproot and relinquish attachment.

       - Cup of Water
  
     * - 來拜訪我的人中，有很多在社會上已有著高等的地位，他們當中有富商、大學畢業的、教師與政府官員。他們內心充滿對事物的種種看法。他們太聰明了，以致聽不進別人的話。這就像一杯水。如果一個杯子裡充滿了骯髒不新鮮的水，它並沒有什麼用處。只有當髒水倒盡，它才有可用之處。你們必須先除去你們充滿意見的心，然後才能領悟。我們的修行是超越聰明與愚痴的，如果你認為你很聰明、富有、重要、是佛學專家，這就掩蓋了「無我」的真諦了。你所見到的只是自己——我、我的。然而，佛教是入下「自我」的。那些太聰明的人將永遠學不到東西，他們首先必須除去他們的才智——空掉他們的「杯子」。
  
       - Many of those who came to see me have a high standing in the community. Among them are merchants, college graduates, teachers, and government officials. Their minds are filled with opinions about things. They are too clever to listen to others. It is like a cup of water. If a cup is filled with stale, dirty water, it is useless. Only after the old water has been thrown out can the cup become useful again. You must empty your minds of opinions, then you will see. Our practice goes beyond cleverness and stupidity. If you think that you are clever, wealthy, important, or an expert in Buddhism, you cover up the truth of non-self - I and mine. But Buddhism is letting go of self. Those who are too clever will never learn. They must first get rid of their cleverness, first empty their "cup".

     * - 【築堤】
  
       - Dam
  
     * - 在定力的訓練裡，是去修行以使心能安定和堅毅，這能帶來心的平靜。通常，我們這顆心是搖擺不定的，要控制它很困難。心隨著感官外馳散亂，就像水到處流竄一樣。雖說如此，人類卻懂得如何控制水，而使它更益於人類。人類很聰明，他們知道如何築堤防水，興建大型水庫和渠道——這一切都只是為了治理水，使水能更充分地被運用而不致於到處亂竄，最後流到最低處，而浪費了水的功能。
  
       - The training in concentration is the practice to make the mind firm and steady. This brings about peacefulness of mind. Usually our minds are moving and restless, hard to control. The mind follows sense distractions wildly, just like water flowing this way and that. Men, though, know how to control water so that it is of greater use to mankind. Men are clever. They know how to dam water, make large reservoirs and canals - all of this merely to channel water and make it more usable, so that it doesn't run wild and eventually settle down into a few low spots, its usefulness wasted.
  
     * - 同樣的，這顆已經「築堤」、被控制、經常訓練的心，將會獲得難以計量的利益。佛陀自己教導說：「已被控制的心，會帶來真正的快樂，因此，為了最大的利益，你們得好好訓練你們的心！」相同地，我們週遭所看到的動物——大象、馬、水牛等等，在它們能被利用來工作之前，都必須先受過訓練，也唯有在訓練之後，它們的力量才能帶給我們利益。
  
       - So, too, the mind that is dammed and controlled, trained constantly, will be of immeasurable benefit. The Buddha himself taught, "The mind that has been controlled brings true happiness, so train your minds well for the highest benefits." Similarly, the animals we see around us - elephants, horses, buffalos, and so on - must be trained before they can be useful for work. Only after they have been trained is their strength of benefit to us.
  
     * - 同樣的道理，已「築堤」的心將帶來比一顆未經訓練的心還要多倍的福澤。佛陀和他的聖弟子們，和我們都一樣在同一個方法下起步——有一顆未經訓練的心。但是，看看他們後來是如何成為我們所尊敬的對象，並且看我們能從他們的教化中得到多少的利益。真的，看看從這些曾經體驗心的訓練而為了達到解脫自在的人們身上，到底帶來了什麼樣的利益給整個世界。在所有的職業中或任何的情形況下，一顆受過控制與訓練的心是套更好且能幫助我們的設備，訓練過的心可以保持我們的生活平衡，使工作更得心應手。並且要發展和培養理性，以便控制我們的行動。只要我們追隨這顆訓練得宜的心，最後，喜悅也會隨著增長起來。
  
       - In the same way, the mind that has been trained will bring many more blessings than an untrained mind. The Buddha and His Noble Disciples all started out in the same way as us - with untrained minds. But, afterwards, look how they became the subjects of reverence for us all. And see how much benefit we can gain from their teachings. Indeed see what benefits have come to the entire world from these men who had gone through the training of the mind to reach the freedom beyond. The mind controlled and trained is better equipped to help us in all professions, in all situations. The disciplined mind will keep our lives balanced, make work easier, and develop and nurture reason to govern our actions. In the end, our happiness will increase accordingly as we follow the proper mind training.

     * - 假設有一個洞，洞下面有東西，現在，只要有人將他的手伸進洞裡卻摸不著底面的話，他就會說：「洞太深了。」如果有百或千個人將他們的手伸進洞裡，他們也同樣會說：「這個洞太深了。」可是，卻沒人會說是自己的手太短了！我們必須回到自己身上，退一步反觀自己，不要埋怨是洞太深，而應該回過頭來看看你自己的手臂。如果你可以看透這點，那麼，在你的性靈道上便能更上一層樓，進而尋找到快樂。
  
       - Suppose there was a hole and there was something at the bottom of it. Now anyone who put his hand into the hole and didn't reach the bottom would say the hole was too deep. If a hundred or a thousand people put their hands down the hole, they'd all say, "The hole is too deep!" No one would say that his arm was too short. We have to come back to ourselves. We have to take a step back and look at ourselves. Don't blame the hole for being too deep. Turn around and look at your own arm. If you can see this, then you will make progress on the spiritual path and will find happiness.

         同樣地，不守戒律，我們的身行和言語也就不清淨，這就是造成心理的不快樂、苦惱而沉重的原因。如果我們遠離了正確的修行，這會障礙我們徹見存在我們心中的法的本質。健全的身行和言語在於一顆正確訓練的心。因為是心傳達命令給身和語，所以，我們必須由「訓練我們的心」來不斷修行。
  
       - It is only natural that when our body is dirty and we put on dirty clothes that our mind will not be light and cheerful but will feel uncomfortable and depressed. So, too, when morality is not practiced, our bodily actions and speech are dirty. This causes the mind to be unhappy, uncomfortable, and distressed. We become separated from right practice and this prevents us from penetrating into the essence of the Dhamma in our mind. Wholesome bodily actions and speech themselves depend on the mind properly trained, since mind orders body and speech. Therefore, we must continue to practice by training our minds.

       - How can you find right understanding? I can answer you simply by using this glass of water I am holding. It appears to us as clean and useful, something to drink from and keep for a long time. Right understanding is to see this as broken glass, as if it has already been shattered. Sooner or later, it will be shattered. If you keep this understanding while you are using it - that all it is is a combination of elements which come together in this form and then break apart - then no matter what happens to the glass, you will have no problem. The body is like the glass. It is also going to break apart and die. You have to understand that. Yet when you do, it doesn't mean you should go and kill yourself, just as you shouldn't take the glass and break it or throw it away. The glass is something to use until it falls apart in its own natural way. In the same way, the body is a vehicle to use until goes its own way. Your task is to see what the natural way of things is. This understanding can make you free in all the changing circumstances of the entire world.

     * - 人們響往涅槃，不過，一旦你告訴他們那兒空無一物時，心裡馬上起第二想。但那兒什麼也沒有，空無一物。看看這兒的屋頂和地板；屋頂代表「有」，而地板也代表「有」，你可以站在屋頂上，也可以站在地板上，但是，在屋頂和地板之間的空間卻無處可站。沒有「有」的地方，就是「空」的所在；直接地，涅槃即是「空」。人們一聽到這兒便退卻不想去了。他們怕會見不著自己的孩子和親戚。
  
       - People want to go to Nibbana but when you tell them that there is nothing there, they begin to have second thoughts. But there's nothing there, nothing at all! Look at the roof and floor here. Think of the roof as a "becoming" and the floor as a "becoming", too. You can stand on the roof and you can stand on the floor, but in the empty space between the roof and the floor there is no place to stand. Where there is no becoming, that's where there's emptiness, and to put it bluntly, we say that Nibbana is this emptiness. People hear this and they back up a bit. They don't want to go. They're afraid that they won't see their children or relatives.
  
     * - 這就是為什麼當我們祝福在家人的時候，會說：「祝你們長壽、美麗、健康、快樂。」他們就會很高興，可是，一旦你談起「放下」和「空」時，他們便不想聽了。但你是否見過一個外表美麗、體力充沛或非常或非常幸福的老人？沒有！然而我們卻說：「長壽、美麗、健康、快樂。」他們也非常歡喜。他們執著「有」，執著生死輪迴。他們歡喜站在屋頂和地板上面，很少有人敢「站」在中間的「空」間。
  
       - That's why whenever we bless the laity by wishing them long life, beauty, and strength, they become very happy. However, if we start talking about letting go and about emptiness they don't want to hear about it. But have you ever seen a very old person with a beautiful complexion, or a lot of strength, or a lot of happiness? No! But we wish them long life; beauty, happiness and strength, and they are all pleased. They're attached to becoming, to the cycle of birth and death. They prefer to stand on the roof or on the floor. Few are they who dare to stand in the empty space between.

       - If you want to find Dhamma, it has nothing to do with the forest with mountains or the caves. It's only in the heart, and has its own language of experience. There is a great difference between concepts and direct experience. With a glass of hot water, whoever puts his finger into it will have the same experience - hot - which can be expressed in as many different words as there are different languages. Similarly, whoever looks deeply into the heart will have the same experience, no matter what his nationality, culture, or language may be. If in your heart you come to that taste of truth, of Dhamma, then you become like one big family - like mother and father, sisters and brothers - because you've tasted that essence of the heart which is the same for all.

     * - 【火】
  
       - Fire
  
     * - 世上沒有一朝可成之事，所以剛開始在我們的修行裡，是看不到什麼結果的。就像我常告訴你們的譬喻：一個人試圖磨擦兩根木棍取火，他告訴自己說：「他們說這裡有火。」於是便開始使勁地磨擦。他很性急，不斷地磨擦，就是沒什麼耐性，心想火，卻一直沒有火的影子。他有點灰心，所以就停下來休息一會兒，後來又再開始，但是到了那時候，熱度都已經冷卻，所以進展得很慢。他就是磨擦持續的時間不夠久，以致一再地磨擦又磨擦，直到疲倦了，就將整個工作停頓下來，再說，他不只是疲倦，同時也變得愈來愈灰心，最後完全放棄且很堅決地說：「這裡根本沒有火。」
  
       - Nothing happens immediately, so in the beginning we can't see any results from our practice. This is like the example that I have often given you of the man who tries to make fire by rubbing two sticks together. "They say there's fire here!" He says, looking at his sticks. He then begins rubbing energetically. He rubs on and on, but soon becomes impatient. He wants to have that fire, but the fire just won't come, so he gets discouraged and stops to rest for while. When he starts again the initial heat that he had worked up has already been lost so the going is slow. He just doesn't keep at long enough. He rubs and rubs until he is tired and stops altogether. Not only is he tired, but he becomes more and more discouraged. "There is no fire here!" He finally decides and gives up completely.
  
     * - 事實上，他一直在做，但是卻沒有足夠的熱度可以引火，火一直潛在那兒，只是他沒有持續到最後。除非我們能達到平靜，否則心將依舊如前。因此我們偉大的導師說：「只要繼續做，繼續修行。」我們可能會認為：「如果我仍然不懂，我該怎麼辦才好？」但是，除非我們如法修持，否則智慧是不會現前的，所以我們說要持續地修行。只要不停地修行，我們就會開始思索自己的所作所為和修行。
  
       - Actually he was doing the work, but there wasn't enough heat to start the fire. The fire was there all the time, but he didn't carry on to the end. Likewise with the mind. Until we are able to reach peace, the mind will continue in its confusion. For this reason the teacher says, "Just keep on doing it. Keep on with the practice!" Maybe we think, "If I don't yet understand, how can I do it?" Until we're able to practice properly, wisdom won't arise. So we say just keep on with it.

       - We don't want desire, but if there is no desire, why practice? We must have desire to practice. Buddha had desire too. It's there all the time, but it's only a condition of the mind. Those with wisdom, however, have desire but no attachment. Our desires are like catching a big fish in a net - we must wait until the fish loses strength and then we can catch it easily. But all the time we must keep on watching it so that it doesn't escape.

       - If you see clearly the harm in the benefit of something, you won't have to wait for others to tell you about it. Consider the story of the fisherman who finds something in his fish trap. He knows something is in it because he can hear it flopping about inside. Thinking it's a fish; he reaches his hand into the trap, only to grab hold of a different kind of animal. He can't see it, so he's not sure what it is. It could be an eel, but it could also be a snake. If he throws it away, he may regret it, for if it turns out to be in eel, he'll have lost something nice for dinner. On the other hand, if he keeps on holding onto it and it turns out to be a snake, it may bite him. He's just not sure. But his desire is so strong that he holds on, just in case it's an eel. The minute he brings it out and sees that it's a snake, however, he doesn't hesitate to fling it away from himself. He doesn't have to wait for someone to call out, "Hey, it's a snake! Let go!" The site of the snake tells him what to do more clearly than words could ever do. Why? Because he sees the danger - snakes can bite and make you very sick or kill you. Who has to tell him about that? In the same way, if we practice until we see things as they are, we won't meddle with things that are harmful.

     * - 我們的禪定(靜慮)的修行可以使我們開解。舉個例子來說吧：譬如有個正在收網的漁夫，網中有條大魚，你能推想他收網時的心情是如何嗎？如果他深怕大魚跑掉，就會迫不及待地硬扯那網子，在他覺察之前，魚兒已經因為他操之過急而讓它跑掉了。
  
       - Our practice of contemplation will lead us to understanding. Let us take the example of a fisherman pulling in his net with a big fish in it. How do you think he feels when pulling it in again? If he's afraid that the fish will escape, he'll rush and start to struggle with the net, grabbing and tugging at it. In this way, before he knows it, the big fish will have escaped. The fisherman mustn't try to hard.
  
     * - 古時候，他們會這樣教我們：你們應該慢慢地來，小小心心地收網，以免讓魚兒脫逃。我們修行也正是如此，慢慢地靠修持來摸索出自己的道路，小心地收網以免遺漏了。有時，我們會遇到不喜歡修行的時候，也許我們不想瞭解，也不想知道，但是我們卻要繼續修行下去，繼續為修行摸索下去，這就是修行。如果喜歡修行，就去修行；不喜歡修行，也一樣要修行，就是要持之以恆。
  
       - In the old days, they taught that we should do it gradually, carefully gathering it in without losing it. This is how it is in our practice. We gradually feel our way with it, carefully gathering it in without losing it. Sometimes it happens that we don't feel like practicing. Maybe we don't want to look, or maybe we don't want to know, but we keep on with it. We continue feeling for it. This is the practice. If we feel like doing it, we do it. If we don't feel like doing it, we do it just the same. We just keep on doing it.
  
     * - 我們若是精進修行，那麼，信心就會給我們的修行帶來力量。不過，在此階段，我們仍然沒有智慧，縱使我們非常精進，也無法從修行中得到多少益處。這種情況會持續一段很長的時間，因而使我們生起一種永遠無法尋到正道的感覺，也或許覺得自己達不到平靜，或覺得自己沒有具備足夠的條件來修行，乃至認為「道」是件不可能的事。於是我們便放棄了！
  
       - If we are enthusiastic about our practice, the power of our faith will give us the energy needed to practice, but we will still be without wisdom. Being energetic alone won't make us benefit much from our practice. On the contrary, after practicing energetically for long time, the feeling that we are not going to find the Way may arise. We may feel that we cannot find peace, or that we're not sufficiently equipped to do the practice. Or maybe we feel that this Way just isn't possible anymore. So we give up!
  
     * - 說到這點，我們必須非常、非常地小心，我們要以很大的耐心和毅力，猶如網起大魚一樣——逐漸與它探索出自己的方法，然後小心地把魚網收回，扯那網子才不會太困難，所以我們繼續不斷地收網。經過一段時間以後，魚兒累得不能再掙扎時，我們就能輕而易舉地捕獲它了。這些都是修行通常會發生的事，不過我們只須慢慢地修持和小心謹慎地將修行聚集在一起。我們就是用這種方式來禪修的。
  
       - At this point, we must be very, very careful. We must use patience and endurance. It's just like pulling in the big fish - we gradually feel our way with it, we carefully pull it in. The struggle won't be too difficult, so continue to pull it in without stopping. Eventually, after some time, the fish becomes tired and stops fighting and we're able to catch it easily. Usually this is how it happens. We practice gradually and carefully, gathering it together. It's in this manner that we do our contemplation.

       - In Buddhism we are endlessly hearing about letting go and about not clinging to anything. What does this mean? It means to take hold of but not to cling. Take this flashlight, for example. We wonder: "What is this?" So we pick it up: "Oh, it's a flashlight." Then we put it down again. We take hold of things, even of wanting, in this way. If we didn't take hold of wanting, what could we do? We couldn't do walking meditation or anything else. It's wanting, yes, a defilement, that's true, but later on that leads to perfection. So we must take hold of things first.
  
     * - 到這裡來也是一樣。首先你必須想來這裡，如果你不想來，今天你們也不會在此地。我們是因慾望而有行動的，但當慾望升起時，不要去執著它，就好像我們不會去執著那隻手電筒一樣——「這是什麼？」我們撿起來，「噢，是隻手電筒！」於是就放下它。這就是「取而不著」的含義。知道了後，就放下，不要愚痴地執著事物，但要以智慧「取」，然後放下它們。善或惡，兩者皆要全盤放下。
  
       - It is like coming here. First you had to want to come here. If you didn't want to, you wouldn't be here today. We do things because of wanting, but when wanting arises, we don't cling to it, just like we don't cling to that flashlight - "What's this?" We pick it up. "Oh, it's a flashlight." We then put it down again. This is what "holding but not clinging" means. We know and then we let go. We don't foolishly cling to things, but we "hold" them with wisdom and then let them go. Good or bad, we let them all go.

       - Not having full, clear knowledge of the true nature of things, we will go on thinking that we are the sankharas or that we are happiness and unhappiness. The truth is that we can't force things to follow our desires. They follow the way of Nature.
  
     * - 這有一個簡單的譬喻：假設你坐在高速公路中央，有很多汽車和卡車急撞你而來，你不能生氣地對車子喊道：「不准行駛到這裡！不准行駛到這裡！」這是高速公路，你不能這樣告訴他們，所以你該怎麼辦呢？你必須下高速公路！高速公路是車子行駛的地方，假如你不准車子在那裡，你就會痛苦。
  
       - A simple comparison is this: Suppose you go and sit in the middle of a freeway with the cars and trucks speeding down toward you. You can't get angry at the cars, shouting, "Don't drive over here! Don't drive over here!" It's a freeway. You can't tell them that. So what can you do? You get off the road. The road is the place where cars run. If you don't want the cars to be there, you suffer.
  
     * - 「行」也是一樣的，我們說是它們擾亂我們，如同我們靜坐時聽到聲音一樣，我們認為：「噢！是那聲音在干擾我。」假如我們認為是聲音干擾了我們，我們將會因此而痛苦。如果我們再深入地觀察，我們會瞭解，原來是我們出去幹擾了那聲音。聲音其實只是聲音。假如能這樣理解，那麼聲音也只是聲音。我們可以讓它去！我們瞭解聲音是一回事兒，和我們並不相干。這是真知真理，兩邊你皆看透了，所以才得果樹平靜。假如你只看到一邊，痛苦！一旦看穿兩邊，便是遵循中道了。這是心的正確的修行，也就是我們所謂的「修正我們的知見」。
  
       - It's the same with sankharas. We say they disturb us, like when we sit in meditation and hear a sound. We think, "Oh, that sound's bothering me!" If we understand that the sound bothers us, then we suffer accordingly. If we investigate a little deeper, we will see that it's we who go out and disturb the sound. The sound is simply sound. If we understand it in this way, then there's nothing more to it. We leave the sound alone. We see that the sound is one thing and we are another. This is real knowledge of the truth. We see both sides, so we have peace. If we see only one side there is suffering. Once we see both sides, then we follow the Middle Way. This is the right practice of the mind. This is what we call straightening out our understanding.
  
     * - 同樣地，一切「行」的本質是無常和死滅的，但是我們卻要捉住它們，背負它們，貪著它們，我們希望它們是真實的，我們希望在不是真實的事物中發現真實！不管什麼時候，若有人有這樣的想法，並執著「行」就是他自己，他會痛若不堪，佛陀要我們好好思惟這個道理。
  
       - In the same way, impermanence and death are the nature of all sankharas, but we don't want it that way. We want the opposite to be true. We want to find truth within the things that aren't true. Whenever someone sees like this and clings to the sankharas as being himself, he suffers. The Buddha told us to contemplate this.

       - Fruit Tree
  
     * - 當微風吹過一棵正開著花的果樹時，有些花朵會散落在地，有一些花苞則仍留滯在樹上，長成小小的青色果子；當風再一次吹來，一些青色果子也會隨之掉落，在它們掉落之前，有些已接近成熟，有些則已經熟透。
  
       - When a fruit tree is in bloom, a strong gust of wind will blow some of its blossoms to the ground. Those that don't fall will eventually grow into small green fruit. But then another gust comes and some of them will fall, too. As for the rest, they will grow to become fruit nearly ripe, or even fully ripe, before they fall.
  
     * - 人，就像在風中的花朵和果實，也在生命的不同階段中「墮落」。有的在胎中就夭折；有的僅在出世幾天後就死了；有的在世幾年還未成年便去世；有的男女英年早逝；而有的人卻壽終正寢。當我們想到人的時候，應該連帶想起風中的果實——兩者都是非常不穩定的。
  
       - And so it is with people. Like flowers and fruit in the wind, they, too, fall in different stages of life. Some people die while still in the womb, others within only a few days after birth. Some people live for a few years, then die, never having reached maturity. Some die in their youth. Still others reach a ripe old age before they die. When reflecting upon people, consider the nature of fruit in the wind - both are uncertain.
  
     * - 我們的心也一樣，當法塵生起，在心中糾纏和「吹」一陣子後，心於是「墮落」了——就跟風中的果實一樣。
  
       - Our minds are also uncertain. A mental impression arises, draws and blows at the mind, and then the mind falls - just like fruit.
  
     * - 佛陀瞭解除一切事物不穩定的性質，他觀察果實在風中的情形，以此反觀他的弟子——比丘及沙彌們，他發現：基本上，他們也是一樣不穩定！怎麼可能有例外呢？這就是一切事物的本然。
  
       - The Buddha understood this uncertain nature of things. He observed the phenomena of fruit in the wind and reflected upon the monks and novices who were his disciples. He found that they, too, were essentially of the same nature - uncertain! How could it be otherwise? This is just the way of all things.

       - If your mind becomes quiet and concentrated, it is an important tool to use. But if you're sitting just to get concentrated so you can feel happy and pleasant, they you're wasting your time. The practice is to sit and let your mind become still and concentrated, and then use that quiet concentration to examine the nature of the mind and body. If you make the mind simply quiet with no investigation, however, then for that time it's peaceful and there is no defilement, but that is like taking a stone and covering up a smelly garbage pit. When you take the stone away, it's still full of smelly garbage. You must use your concentration, not to attain temporary bliss, but to accurately examine the nature of the mind and body. This is what actually frees you.

     * - 我們應該觀察身體裡的身體。不管身體裡有什麼東西，去看看它吧！如果我們祗看外表，那是不清楚的。我們所看的頭髮、指甲等等，它們的漂亮迷惑了我們，所以佛陀教我們看看身體的內部——身體裡的身體。身體裡面有什麼東西？仔細地看清楚！我們會看見裡面有很多東西會使我們很驚訝，因為縱然這些東西在我們體內，我們卻從來沒有看過它們。無論走到哪裡，我們都帶著它們，可是卻不認識它們。
  
       - We should investigate the body within the body. Whatever's in the body, go ahead and look at it. If we just see the outside, it's not clear. We see hair, nails, and so on and they are just pretty things that entice us. So the Buddha taught us to look at the inside of the body, to see the body within the body. What is the body? Look closely and see! We will see even though it is within us, we've never seen it. Wherever we go we carry it with us, but we still don't know it at all.
  
     * - 就像我們造訪親友的家，他們送我們禮物，我們接受後，把它放入袋中，卻擱著沒去打開來看裡頭是什麼東西。最後，當我們打開它時卻發現裡頭全都毒蛇！
  
       - It's as if we go and visit some relatives at their house and they give us a gift. We take it and put it in our bag and then leave without opening it to see what is inside. When at last we open it we find it is full of poisonous snakes!
  
     * - 我們的身體也是如此。如果我們祗看身體的外表，就以為它很完美、很漂亮，我們忘了自己，忘了無常、苦、無我。如果我們觀察這身體的內在，真的很噁心，裡頭根本沒有一樣美麗的東西。如果我們如實觀照，不故意去美化它的話，我們將會發現那真是可悲和令人厭煩，接著就會生起厭離心。這種厭離的感覺並不是要我們仇視這個世間，而是我們的心逐漸清明，心能放下了。我們看清一切事物都是不實在、不可靠的。不管我們對它們懷有多大的希望，它們仍會無情地離去——無常的事物還是無常；不完美的事物還是不完美。
  
       - Our body is like that. If we just see the shell of it, we say it's fine and beautiful. We forget ourselves. We forget impermanence, unsatisfactoriness and not-self. If we look within this body, it's really repulsive. There's nothing beautiful in it. If we look according to reality, without trying to sugar things over, we'll see that it's really sad and wearisome. Dispassion will then arise. This feeling of disinterest does not come from feeling an aversion toward the world. It's simply our mind clearing up, our mind letting go. We see all things as not being substantial or dependable. However we want them to be, they just go their own way, regardless. Things that are unstable are unstable. Things that are not beautiful are not beautiful.
  
     * - 所以佛陀說，當我們經驗到色、聲、香、味、觸、法時，應該要遠離它們。不管快樂或不快樂，其實都一樣，所以放下它們吧！
  
       - So the Buddha said that when we experience sights, sounds, tastes, smells, bodily feelings or mental states, we should let them go. Whether happiness or unhappiness, they're all the same. So let them go!

     * - 你必須沉思，其目的是為了尋求平靜。一般人通常所指的平靜只是心的平定，而非連雜染也平定下來。雜染只是暫時地被壓制著，如同小草被石頭壓住一樣。如果你把石頭移開，小草將在極短的時間裡再次茂盛起來。其實，小草並沒有死去，只是暫被壓迫著而已。
  
       - You must contemplate in order to find peace. What people usually mean whenever they say peace is only the calming down of the mind and not the calming down of the defilements. The defilements are simply being temporarily subdued, just like grass being covered by a stone. If you take the stone away, the grass will grow back again in a short time. The grass hadn't really died; it was just being suppressed.
  
     * - 禪坐中也是一樣。雖然心很平靜，但是，雜染並沒有完全靜下來。因此，「三摩地」(定)並不可靠，若要尋得真正的平靜，必定要增長你的智慧才行。「三摩地」是一種的平靜，可是它就像石頭壓住小草，不過只是暫時的平靜罷了。智慧的平靜是將大石放下就不去移動它。如此一來，小草永遠也不可能再重生。這就是真實的寧靜，它們皆來自於智慧。
  
       - It's the same when sitting in meditation. The mind is calm, but the defilements are not really calm. Therefore samadhi is not a sure thing. To find real peace you must develop wisdom. Samadhi is one kind of peace, like the stone covering the grass. This is only a temporary peace. The peace of wisdom is like putting the stone down and just leaving it there. In this way the grass can't possibly grow back again. This is real peace, the calming of the defilements, the sure peace that results from wisdom.

     * - 事實上，從某方面來說，學習與修行這兩種方式，其實是同一件事。我們把它想作是手心和手背，可能會比較容易瞭解。如果我們把手伸出來，手背好像不見了，其實它並沒有消失，只是藏在下面而已。當我們再把手翻過來時，會有相同的情形發生，手心哪裡都沒去，只是藏在下而罷了。
  
       - Actually, in one sense, these two ways of study and practice are exactly the same thing. We can understand this better if we consider the front and back of our hand. If we hold our hand out, it seems like the back of our hand has disappeared. Actually the back of our hand hasn't gone anywhere. It's merely hidden underneath.
  
     * - 談到修行時，這點我們必須牢牢記住，假使我們認為它「消失」，就會改變心意而去做研究，希望能在研究中得到結果。不過，無論你下多少功夫研究佛法，你將永遠無法瞭解佛法，因為依據真理，你並不真的瞭解它。假若我們懂得佛法的如實本性，就會開始放下。放下就是——除去執著，不再有執著，就算仍有，也會逐漸減少。研究與修行之間，就有這種差異。
  
       - We should keep this in mind when we consider practice. If we think that it has "disappeared," we'll go off to study, hoping to get results. But it doesn't matter how much we study the Dhamma, we'll never understand it if we don't know it in accordance with Truth. If we do understand the real nature of Dhamma, then we begin to let go. This is surrendering, removing attachment, not clinging anymore, or if there is still clinging, it diminishes as time goes by. So study and practice are really just two sides of the same hand.

It is as if I see someone coming down a road he isn't familiar with but which I have traveled on many times before. I look up and see him about to fall into a hole on the right-hand side of the road, so I call out to him to go left. Likewise, if I see someone else about to fall into a hole on the left, I call out to him to go right. The instructions are different, but I teach them to travel in the same direction on the same road. I teach them to let go of both extremes and come back to the center where they will arrive at the true Dhamma.

       - The Buddha and his disciples once saw a jackal run out of the forest they were staying in. It stood still for a while, then it ran into the underbrush, and then out again. Then it ran into a tree hollow, then out again. One minute it stood, the next it ran, then it lay down, then it jumped up. The jackal had the mange. When it stood, the mange would eat into its skin, so it would run. Running, it was still uncomfortable, so it would stop. Standing, it was still uncomfortable, so it would lie down. Then it would jump up again, running to the underbrush, the tree hollow, never staying still.
  
     * - 佛陀說：「比丘們，今天下午你們有沒有看見那隻狼狗？站著苦，跑也苦；坐下來苦，躺下來也苦；它怪是站著使它不舒服，又說坐不好，跑不好，躺也不好。它怪樹、樹叢、洞穴都不好。事實上問題跟這都無關，，而是在它身上的疥癬。」
  
       - The Buddha said, "Monks, did you see that jackal this afternoon? Standing, it suffered. Lying down, it suffered. It blamed standing for its discomfort. It blamed sitting. It blamed running and lying down. It blamed the tree, the underbrush, and the cave. In fact, the problem was with none of those things. The problem was with his mange."
  
     * - 我們就跟那隻狼狗一樣。我們的不快樂由於錯誤的知見。因為我們不自我約制感官，因此責怪外界帶給我們苦痛。無論我們住在泰國、美國或英國，我們都不滿足。為什麼呢？因為我們的知見還不正確，只是如此罷了！所以無論我們走到哪兒，都會不快樂。如同那隻狼狗，無論它走到哪裡，只要疥癬治好後，才會感到輕鬆愉快。因此，當我們除去我們的不正見時，不管走到哪兒，都會很快樂。
  
       - We are just the same as the jackal. Our discontent is due to wrong view. Because we don't exercise sense restraint, we blame our suffering on externals. Whether we live in Thailand, America or England, we aren't satisfied. Why not? Because we still have wrong view. Just that! So wherever we go, we aren't content. But just as that jackal would be content wherever it went as soon as its mange was cured, so would we be content wherever we went once we cured ourselves of wrong view.

       - A knife has a blade, a spine and a handle. Can you lift up only the blade? Can you lift up only the handle? The handle, the spine and the blade are all parts of the same knife. When you pick up the knife, all three parts come up at the same time.
  
     * - 同樣的道理，假如你拿起了善，惡也必然隨至。人們一味地尋求善，試圖拋棄惡，但是，他們卻沒有學習非善和非惡。如果你沒有學習非善和非惡，那麼，你將得不到真實的知見。如果只取善，惡一樣會跟著來；如果只取樂，苦同樣隨至。訓練你的心，直到它超越善、惡，而那就是修行完成的時候。
  
       - In the same way, if you pick up that which is good, the bad must follow. People search for goodness and try to throw away evil, but they don't study that which is neither good nor evil. If you don't study this, then you won't have real understanding. If you pick up goodness, badness follows. If you pick up happiness, suffering follows. Train the mind until it is above good and evil.

We see things in this way, because we have wisdom. We understand that things are impermanent according to their own nature.

     * - 這跟明白萬事萬物並不是一成不變的道理很相近。在這之前，我們認為一切事物都必須如何，就因為如此，繩結只有被愈拉愈緊。這種緊，便是痛苦。這樣的生活是非常緊張的，所以，我們要把結鬆掉一些，而且放輕鬆。為甚麼要放鬆呢？就是因為太緊了。如果我們不執著就可以放鬆了，它並不是一個永遠一成不變的狀態。
  
       - This is similar to understanding that things don't always have to be the way they've always been. Before, we felt that things had to be a certain way, and in so doing, we pulled the knot tighter and tighter. This tightness is suffering. Living that way is very tense. So we loosen the knot a little and relax. Why do we loosen it? Because it's tight! If we don't cling to it, then we can loosen it. It's not a condition that must always be that way.
  
     * - 我們以無常的教導為基礎，明白快樂與不快樂均非恆常，兩者都不能依靠，也絕無恆常的事物。有了這種認識，我們逐漸會不再信賴錯誤的知見，錯誤的知見就會相對地減少，這便是解結的含義，這樣做，結就會愈來愈松，執著也會隨之逐漸根除。
  
       - We use the teaching of impermanence as our basis. We see that both happiness and unhappiness are not permanent. We see them as not dependable. There's absolutely nothing that is permanent. With this kind of understanding, we gradually stop believing in the various moods and feelings that come up in our mind. Wrong understanding will decrease in the same degree that we stop believing in them. This is what is meant by undoing the knot. It continues to become looser. Attachment will be gradually uprooted.

       - If we cut a log of wood and throw it into a river, it floats downstream. If that log doesn't rot or get stuck on one of the banks of the river, it will finally reach the ocean. Likewise, the mind that practices the Middle Way and doesn't attach to either extreme of sensual indulgence or self-mortification will inevitably attain true peace.
  
     * - 在我們譬喻裡的那塊木頭，代表心，河岸的一邊代表愛，另一邊代表恨；或說岸的一邊是快樂，另一邊是不快樂。所謂遵循中道，是瞭解愛、恨和快樂、不快樂的真實面目——祇是感覺而已。一旦獲得這樣的領悟，心就不會那麼輕易地漂向它們而被束縛。這就是領悟的心的修行，不去滋養任何感覺的升起，乃至不會去執著它們。接著，心便自由無礙地漂向下游，最後流入「涅槃海」。
  
       - The log in our analogy represents the mind. The banks of the river represent, on one side, love, and on the other, hate. Or you can say that one bank is happiness and the other unhappiness. To follow the Middle Way is to see love, hate, happiness and unhappiness for what they really are - only feelings. Once this understanding has been achieved, the mind will not easily drift toward them and get caught. It is the practice of the understanding mind not to nurture any feelings that rise or to cling to them. The mind then freely flows down the river unhampered and eventually flows into the "ocean" of Nibbana.

     * - 假如你不花點心思去訓練你的心，它就會隨著它的本性，依然粗俗野蠻。心的本性是可以訓練的，所以它才能有利地被應用。就拿樹來說吧！如果我們將樹原封不動地擱在那兒，我們永遠也無法利用它們來蓋房子，更不能將它製造成建築房子所需的木板或其他材料。總而言之，若有木匠想要蓋房子，他會先去尋找樹木，在取得原木材料後，再加以有利地應用。那麼，在很短的時間裡，他就可以蓋起一棟房子了。
  
       - If you don't bother to train your heart, then it remains wild, following the ways of nature. It's possible to train that nature, however, so that it can be used to advantage. This is comparable to trees. If we just left trees in their natural state, then we would never be able to build houses with them. We couldn't make planks or anything of use to build houses with. However, if a carpenter came along wanting to build a house, he would go looking for trees in their natural state. He would take raw material and use it to advantage. In a short time he could have a house built.
  
     * - 禪坐與心的增長也是如此。你必須對這顆未經訓練的心——如同你會去森林裡取自然狀態下的樹，加以訓練，這樣，心才會對自己更細膩、更清明，而且更為敏銳。
  
       - Meditation and developing the heart are similar to this. You must take this natural, untrained heart as you would take a tree in its natural state in the forest, and train it so that it is more refined, more aware of itself, and more sensitive.

       - We say that morality, concentration and wisdom are the path on which all the Noble Ones have walked to enlightenment. They are all one. Morality is concentration, concentration is morality. Concentration is wisdom, wisdom is concentration. It's like a mango. When it's a flower, we call it a flower. When it becomes a fruit, we call it a mango. When it ripens, we call it a ripe mango. It's a lone mango, but it continually changes. The big mango grows from the small mango, the small mango grows from the small mango, and the small mango becomes a big one. You can call them different fruit or all one. Morality, concentration and wisdom are related like this. In the end it's the entire path that leads to enlightenment.
  
     * - 我們必須瞭解：芒果，它最初出現時是一朵花，然後逐漸長成熟，不管別人怎麼叫它，都沒關係。一旦芒果出生，便步向老熟，然後它會往哪裡去呢？我們要好好思惟這個問題。
  
       - The mango, from the moment it first appears as a flower, simply grows to ripeness. We should see it like this. Whatever others call it, it doesn't matter. Once it's born, it grows to old age and then where? We should contemplate this.
  
     * - 有些人不想要老，當他們老了之後，顯得很不甘心。像這些人實在不應吃已熟的芒果！我們為什麼希望芒果成熟呢？如果時候到了它們還未成熟，我們就會以人工的方法促使它成熟，不是嗎？但是當我們年老時，我們卻滿懷不願。有些人為此掉淚，他們懼怕老死。若是這樣的話，那麼他們最好祇吃花，而不應吃成熟的芒果。如果我們能明白這個道理，我們就能見到佛法。一切都能清楚明白之後，我們就平靜了。
  
       - Some people don't want to be old. When they get old, they become regretful. These people shouldn't eat ripe mangoes. Why do we want the mangoes to be ripe? If they're not ripe in time, we ripen them artificially, don't we? But when we become old we're filled with regret. Some people cry. They're afraid to get old and die. If it's like this, they shouldn't eat ripe mangoes. They'd better eat just the flowers! If we can see this then we can see the Dhamma. Everything clears up and we are at peace.

       - Don't be angry with those who don't practice. Don't speak against them. Just continually advise them. They will come to the Dhamma when their spiritual factors are developed. It's like selling medicines. We advertise our medicines and those with a headache or stomachache will come and take some. Those who don't want our medicines let them be. They're like fruit that are still green. We can't force them to be ripe and sweet — just let them be. Let them grow up, sweeten and ripen all by themselves. If we think like this, our minds will be at ease. So we don't need to force anybody. Simply advertise our medicines and leave it at that. When someone is ill, he'll come around and buy some.

       - Everything that you do you must do with clarity and awareness. When you see clearly, you'll no longer feel the need to force yourself to do and complete everything. Now you are burdened with difficulties because you miss the point: whatever you do, you should just do with your body and mind completely. This will bring you peace. If you think you have to do and complete everything, then whenever you leave something undone or incomplete, you'll feel discontented and never stop worrying about it. You want to complete everything, but it's really impossible to do so.
  
     * - 就拿時常來看我的那些生意人為例，他們說：「當我的債務通通還清，財產也理清時，我就來出家。」話雖這麼說，但他們何時才會結束而準備就緒？永無止期啊！他們用另一個借款來償還債務，還清了一個又借一個。每位生意人都會想，如果能讓他從債務中脫身，他就快樂了，然而還清債務是遙遙無期的。這就是世間愚弄我們的方法。我們就這樣反覆地周旋著，永遠不知道自己的可悲。
  
       - Take the case of the merchants who regularly come here to see me. They say, "Oh, when my debts are all paid and property in order, I'll come to get ordained." They talk like that, but will they ever finish and get it all in order? There's no end to it. They pay off their debts with another loan; they pay off that one, and do it again. A merchant thinks that when he gets rid of all of his debts, he will be happy, but there's no end to paying things off. That's the way worldliness fools us. We go around and around like that never realizing our predicament.

       - Oil and water are different in the same way that a wise man and an ignorant man are different. The Buddha lived with form, sound, odor, taste, touch and thought, but he was an arahant so he was able to turn away from them rather than toward them. He turned away and let go little by little, since he understood that the heart is just the heart and thought is just thought. He didn't confuse them and mix them together like an ignorant man does.
  
     * - 心只是心，想和感覺也只是想和感覺；讓事物就只是事物吧！讓色只是色，讓聲只是聲，讓想只是想，我們又何須費事地執著它們呢？如果我們以這種方式去思考和感覺，那麼，這就是出離和不執著了。我們的想和感覺將在一邊，而我們的心會在另外一邊，就好像油和水——它們同在一個瓶子裡，然而，卻是分開的。
  
       - The heart is just the heart. Thoughts and feelings are just thoughts and feelings. Let things be as they are. Let form be just form, let sound be just sound, let thought be just thought. Why should we bother to attach to them? If we feel and think in this way, then there is detachment and separateness. Our thoughts and feelings will be on one side and our heart will be on the other.

       - Suppose we had a cart, and an ox to pull it. The wheels of the cart aren't long, but the tracks are. As long as the ox pulls the cart, the tracks will follow. The wheels are round, yet the tracks are long. Just looking at the stationary cart, one couldn't see anything long about the wheels, but once the ox starts pulling the cart, we see the tracks stretching out behind. As long as the ox keeps pulling, the wheels keep turning. But there comes a day when the ox gets tired and throws off its yoke. The ox walks off and the cart is left there. The wheels no longer turn. In time the cart falls apart. Its constituent parts go back into the four elements of earth, water, wind and fire.
  
     * - 跟隨世間法的人們也是一樣！如果有人想在世間法裡尋找寧靜，他將無停歇地像車輪所輾出的輪跡一樣，繼續下去。如果我們不斷追隨世間法，我們就沒得停止、沒得歇息。只要我們很單純地停止追隨世間法，車輪便會停止不再轉動。不停地追隨世間法，輪跡就會繼續不斷延伸，製造惡業也是一樣。只要我們再次地重蹈覆轍，一切將永無止期。如果我們停止，一切也將停止。這就是佛法的修習。
  
       - People who follow the world are the same. If one were to look for peace within the world, one would go on and on without end, just like the wheels of a cart. As long as we follow the world, there is no stopping, no rest. If we simply stop following it, the wheels of the cart no longer turn. There is stopping right there. Following the world ceaselessly, the tracks go on. Creating bad kamma is like this. As long as we continue to follow the old ways, there is no stopping. If we stop, then there is stopping. This is the practice of Dhamma.

       - The teaching that people least understand and which conflicts most with their own opinions is the teaching of letting go or working with the empty mind. When we conceive this in worldly terms, we become confused and think that we can do anything we want. It can be interpreted in this way, but its real meaning is closer to this: It's as if we were carrying a heavy rock. After a while we begin to feel its weight, but we don't know how to let go. So we endure this heavy burden all the time. If someone tells us to throw it away, we say, "If I throw it away, I won't have anything left!" If told of all the benefits to be gained by throwing it away, we would not believe it, but would keep on thinking, "If I throw my rock away, I will have nothing." So we keep on carrying this heavy rock until it becomes so unbearably heavy, and we become so weak and exhausted, that we just have to drop it.
  
     * - 放下它之後，才突然間體會到放下的益處，我們立即覺得較舒適，也較輕鬆，並且明白背負著一顆石頭是個多麼沉重的負擔啊！而在我們放下這顆石頭之前，我們不可能瞭解放下的益處。我們也許又會再度扛起這個包袱，但現在我們已經知道這樣做將會有什麼後果，因此我們能更輕易的放下它。「背負著沉重包袱是沒用的，相反地，放下，將帶來舒適與輕安」這樣的理解，是一個能夠逐漸瞭解我們自己的好例子。
  
       - Having dropped it, we suddenly experience the benefits of letting go. We immediately feel better and lighter and we know for ourselves how much of a burden carrying a rock can be. Before we let go of the rock, we couldn't possibly know the benefits of letting go. Later on we may start carrying burdens again, but now we know what the results will be, so we can now let go more easily. This understanding - that it's useless carrying burdens around and that letting go brings ease and lightness - is an example of knowing ourselves.
  
     * - 我們的自尊，我們所仰賴的自我意識，就如同一顆沉重的石頭。如果我們考慮要放下自我時，我們會懼怕沒有了它之後，將會一無所有。然而，當我們終於放下它時，我們將覺悟到不執著自我的輕安和自在。
  
       - Our pride, our sense of self that we depend on, is the same as that heavy rock. Like that rock, if we think about letting go of self, we are afraid that without it there would be nothing left. But when we can finally let it go we realize for ourselves the ease and comfort of not clinging.

It's not tightly bound within good and evil, within possessions, praise and blame, happiness or suffering. If we don't know the truth, it's like tightening the screw all the time. You screw it down until it crushes you and you suffer over everything. When you unwind out of all that, you become free and at peace.

     * - 禪坐中，你們必須一直維持正念，如同種植一棵樹苗。如果我們將樹苗種在一個地方，三天後將它移植到另外一個地方，過了三天又將它再移植一次，最後，它將在毫無成長和結果的情況下死去。
  
       - In meditation, you must continuously be attentive, just like when planting a seedling. If you plant a seedling in one place, then after three days you pull it up and plant it in another place, and after three more days, pull it up again and plant it somewhere else, it will just die and not grow up and bear any fruit.
  
     * - 禪坐也是如此，假使你只做了七天的禪坐就走了，後來的七個月你一直在任意染污自己的心，事後再回來做禁語和獨處的七天禪坐，這就跟那棵樹苗沒有兩樣了。你的禪坐功夫終將無法成長，最後，將在沒有產生任何真實的果實之情況下死去。
  
       - Meditation is the same. If you do a seven-day meditation retreat and after leaving it, for seven months you go around "soiling" the mind, and then come back and do another seven-day retreat where you don't speak and you keep to yourself, it's like the tree. Your meditation practice won't be able to grow and it will die with out producing any real results.

     * - 當我們說心停止時，是指好像已靜止一樣，不會到處波動攀緣。譬如我們有一把銳利的刀，如果我們毫無選擇地隨意亂砍石頭、磚塊、玻璃之類的東西，刀子很快就會鈍掉。我們必須只砍有用的東西。
  
       - When we say that the mind stops, we mean that it feels as if it's stopped, that it does not go running about here and there. It's as if we have a sharp knife. If we go and cut away at things randomly, like stones, bricks and glass, without choosing carefully, our knife will quickly become blunt. We must cut only those things which are useful to cut.
  
     * - 心也是一樣，如果我們放任我們的心，讓它亂跑，追隨無用的妄念或情緒，心很快就會因為不得休息而疲憊。如果心沒有力量，智慧就不能升起，因為沒有力量的心等於一顆沒有定力的心。
  
       - Our mind is the same. If we let our mind wander after thoughts or feelings which have no use or value, the mind will become weak because it has no chance to rest. If the mind has no energy, wisdom will not arise, because the mind without energy is a mind without concentration.

       - Snake
  
     * - 人們厭惡痛苦而希求快樂，但事實上快樂正是痛苦的微細形態，而痛苦本身是一種較粗糙的形態。我們可以將他們比喻為一條蛇，蛇的頭部表示「苦」，蛇的尾部表示「樂」。蛇的頭部是很危險的，因為牠有毒牙，如果你觸碰牠，牠會立刻咬你一口，但是不消說，即使你去抓蛇尾，同樣地，牠會立刻轉身咬你，因為蛇頭和蛇尾同在一條蛇身上。
  
       - People want happiness, not suffering. But in fact happiness is just a refined form of suffering. Suffering itself is the coarse form. We can compare them to a snake. The snake's head is unhappiness. The snake's tail is happiness. The snake's head is really dangerous. It has the poisonous fangs. If we touch it, it'll bite right away. But never mind the head? Even if we go and hold onto the tail, it will turn around and bite us just the same, because both the head and tail belong to the one snake.
  
     * - 同樣的道理，快樂和不快樂，或愉快和悲傷，是從同一條「蛇」——慾望，所生起的。所以當你快樂時，心並不是平靜的。
  
       - Likewise happiness and unhappiness, pleasure and sadness, arise from the same snake: wanting. So when we're happy, the mind isn't really peaceful.
  
     * - 例如當我們得到我們所喜歡的，像財富、威望、讚美或幸福時，所得的結果便是快樂的。但是心中卻仍舊隱藏著不安，因為我們害怕會失去它。極為憂慮並非平靜，往後我們可能真的失去這些，緊接而來的便是痛苦。因此，如果我們不清醒的話，即使是快樂，繼之而來的便是痛苦。正如同抓住蛇尾一樣——如果你不放手，牠就會轉身咬你。所以，無論是蛇頭或蛇尾，也就是說，健全或不健全的狀況，他們都是輪迴的特徵，與無限的變遷。
  
       - For example, when we get the things we like, such as wealth, prestige, praise or happiness, we become pleased, but the mind remains uneasy for fear of losing them. That very fear isn't a peaceful state. Later we may really lose those things, then we truly suffer. So if we're not aware, even when happy, suffering is imminent. It's just like grabbing the snake's tail - if we don't let go, it'll bit. So be it the snake's conditions they're all just characteristics of the Wheel of Existence, of endless change.

       - Watching a spider can give rise to wisdom. A spider spins its webs in any convenient niche and then sits in the center, staying still. Later a fly comes along and lands on its web. As soon as the fly touches and shakes the web - boop! ' the spider pounces on it and winds it up in thread. It stores the insect away and then returns again to collect itself silently in the center of its web.
  
     * - 這與我們的心是一樣的。我們的心可喻為蜘蛛，我們的情緒和法塵可以觀察各種昆蟲。心常被各種環繞的感官所刺激，當根、塵接觸時，迅速地傳達給心識，經由心識徹底的審視和檢查之後，又回到中央來。「回到中央」，意思是住於正念和正知，經常地保持警覺，並正確、精密地做每一件事——這就是我們的中心。事實上，我們不須大費周章，只要照著這個方法小心地生活就夠了。但並不是要我們漫不經心地生活，認為「沒有必要禪坐或行禪！」因而忘記了所有的修行。我們不能掉以輕心，我們必須保持警覺，就像蜘蛛守候獵物一般。這就是我們要安住的方法——保持警覺，謹慎的行止，時時以智慧覺知。
  
       - This is not at all different from our own minds. Our mind is comparable to the spider, and our moods and mental impressions to the various insects. The senses constantly stimulate the mind. When any of them contacts something, it immediately reaches the mind. The mind then investigates and examines it thoroughly, after which it returns to the center. "Coming to the center" means living mindfully with clear comprehension, being always alert and doing everything with precision - this is our center. There's really not a lot for us to do. We just carefully live in this way. But that doesn't mean that we live heedlessly thinking, "No need to do sitting or walking meditation!" and so forget all about our practice. We can't be careless. We must remain alert like the spider waiting to snatch up insects for its food. This is how we abide - alert, acting with precision and always mindfully comprehending with wisdom.

       - A man comes walking along a road. He is very thirsty from his journey and is craving for a drink of water. He stops at a place beside the road and asks for a drink. The owner of the water says, "You can drink this water if you like. The color is good, the smell is good, the taste is good, too, but if you drink it, you will become ill. It'll make you sick enough to die or nearly die." The thirsty man does not listen. He's as thirsty as a person after an operation who has been denied a good drink of water for a while. He's crying for water! So he dips out a bit of water and swallows it down, finding it very tasty. He drinks his fill and gets so sick that he almost dies. He didn't listen to the warning that was given to him because of his overpowering desire.
  
     * - 這就是為什麼人會被感官快樂所繫縛一樣。佛陀說它們都是毒，但因為他太「渴」了，所以聽不進去。他啜飲色、聲、香、味、觸、法，更何況它們都非常甘美，所以他喝個不停，結果很快地喝上癮了，一直到死為止。
  
       - This is how it is for a person caught in the pleasures of the senses. The Buddha taught that they are poisonous but he is thirsty and so he doesn't listen. He drinks in sights, sounds, smells, tastes, tactile sensations and mind-objects and they are all delicious. So he drinks without stopping, and there he remains stuck fast until the day he dies.

       - Naturally people who wish to reach their home are not those who merely sit and think about traveling. They must actually undertake the process of traveling step by step, and in the right direction as well, in order to finally reach home. If they take the wrong path, they may eventually run into difficulties, such as swamps or other obstacles, which are hard to get around. Or they may run into dangerous situations and thereby possibly never reach home.

       - Those who reach home can relax and sleep comfortably. Home is a place of comfort. But if the traveler only passed by the front of his home or only walked around it, he would not receive any benefit from having traveled all the way home.
  
     * - 同樣的道理，走往契達佛法的路上，必須靠我們每一個人親自實踐才行，因為，除了你自己以外，沒有人能夠替代你。此外，我們必須沿著戒、定、慧行去，直到我們發現心中的清淨、光明、寧靜的福澤，這便是行旅在道上的果實。
  
       - In the same way, walking the path to reach the Buddha-Dhamma is something each one of us must do individually ourselves, for no one can do it for us. And we must travel along the proper path of morality, concentration and wisdom until we find the blessings of purity, radiance and peacefulness of mind that are the fruits of traveling the path.
  
     * - 但是，假使一個人僅僅擁有書本及經典上的知識，那也只是旅遊上對地圖或計畫的知識罷了！縱使幾百年過後，永遠也不知曉心的清淨、光明和寧靜，這都只在浪費時間而已。永遠得不到修行帶來的真實利益。老師，是指出道路的人，聽取老師的教誨之後，無論我們是否要修行走這條路，以及而後所得的修行成果，完全取決於我們自己。
  
       - However if one only has knowledge of books, sermons, and sutras, that is, only knowledge of the map or plans for the journey, even in hundreds of lifetimes one will never know purity, radiance and peacefulness of mind. Instead one will just waste time and never get to the real benefits of practice. Teachers are those who point out the direction of the Path. After listening to the teachers, whether or not we walk the Path by practicing ourselves, and thereby reap the fruits of practice, is strictly up to each one of us.

       - We can learn Dhamma from trees. A tree is born due to a cause and it, grows following the course of nature until it buds, flowers and bears fruit. Right here the tree is discoursing Dhamma to us, but we don't understand this. We're unable to bring it within and contemplate, so we don't know that the tree is teaching us without investigating: sweet, sour or bitter, it's the nature of the fruit. And this is Dhamma, the teaching of the fruit. Then the leaves grow old. They wither, die and fall from the tree. All we see is that the leaves have fallen down. We don't know that nature is teaching us. Later on, the new leaves sprout, and we merely see that, without taking it further. This is not the truth that is known through internal reflection.
  
     * - 如果我們可以將它們引領到內心來觀照，我們會忽然瞭解，樹的誕生與我們自己誕生的道理其實沒有什麼差別。我們身體的出生與存在是依靠某些條件，它們是地、水、火、風。身體每一個部份都會依循它的本性而改變，這和樹沒有什麼差別——頭髮、指甲、牙齒和皮膚都在改變。如果我們瞭解事物的本然，那麼我們也將瞭解自己。
  
       - If we can bring all this inward and investigate it, we will see that the birth of a tree and our own birth are no different. This body of ours is born and exists, dependent on conditions, on the elements of earth, water, wind and fire. Every part of the body changes according to its nature. It's no different from the tree. Hair, nails, teeth and skin, all change. If we know the things of nature, then we will know ourselves.

     * - 最好的例子就是住在森林裡的野雞。我們都知道，牠們非常懼怕人類。自從我在森林裡居住以來，我在教導牠們的同時，也從牠們身上學習到很多東西。剛開始我撒一些米給牠們吃，起初牠們很害怕，所以不敢接近米，但不久之後，牠們漸漸習慣了，而且也開始期待。牠們原先以為米是危險的敵人。事實上，米並沒有危險性，因為牠們並不瞭解米是食物，所以會害怕。當牠們最後知道沒有什麼好懼怕之後，便毫無顧慮的吃起來了。野雞是在這種方式下很自然地學習。
  
       - A good example is the wild chickens in the forest. We all know how much they fear humans. Yet since I've lived in the forest, I've been able to teach them and learn from them too. I began by throwing them rice to eat. At first they were afraid and wouldn't go near the rice. But after a while they got used to it and even began to expect it. They first thought the rice was a dangerous enemy. But there was no danger in the rice. They just didn't know the rice was food, so they were afraid. When they finally saw there was nothing to fear, they could come and eat peacefully. Wild chickens learn naturally like this.
  
     * - 住在森林裡，我們也要以同樣的方式來學習。以前我們認為我們的感官是問題所在，因為我們還無知於如何正確地利用它們，於是給我們造成許多麻煩。但是藉由修行的經驗，我們學習如實地了知它們。我們學習如何利用感官，正如野雞吃米一樣。那麼，感官就不會再與我們作對，問題自然也就沒有了。
  
       - Living here in the forest, we learn in the same way. Before, we thought our senses were a problem, and because we thought our senses were a problem, and because we didn't know how to use them properly, they were troublesome. Through experience in practice, however, we learn to se them according to the Truth. We learn to use them, just as the chickens did with the rice. Then they're no longer against us and problems disappear.

     * - 人們總會認為西方人住在阿姜查的寺院裡，語言上一定是個問題，但事實卻不然。有一次有人來問阿姜查：「您是如何教導那些外國弟子的呢？您會說英語、法語嗎？還是會說日語或德語呢？」
  
       - People often presume there would be a problem with language for the Westerners who wanted to stay at Ajahn Chah's monastery, but this was not the case. Someone once asked Ajahn Chah, "How do you teach all your Western disciples? Do you speak English or French? Do you speak Japanese or German?"
  
     * - 「不會！」阿姜 查回答。
  
       - "No," replied Ajahn Chah.
  
     * - 「那他們怎麼辦？」這個人問。
  
       - "Then how do they manage?" he asked.
  
     * - 「這位居士啊！」阿姜 查問：「你的家園子裡有水牛嗎？」
  
       - "Do you have water-buffalos in your yard at home?"
  
     * - 「有的。」他回答。
  
       - "Yes, I do."
  
     * - 「你有沒有牛，或狗、雞等……？」
  
       - "Do you have any cows, or dogs, or chickens?"
  
     * - 「有啊！」他回答。
  
       - "Yes, I have them, too," was the reply.
  
     * - 「那請你告訴我，」阿姜 查問道：「你會說水牛的話嗎？你會說牛的話嗎？」
  
       - "Tell me," Ajahn Chah asked, "do you speak Water-buffalo or Cow?"
  
     * - 「我不會啊！」
  
       - "No, of course not."
  
     * - 「很好，那牠們怎麼辦呢？」
  
       - "Well, how do you manage then?"
